<b>Textbook:</b> Introduction to Perturbation Methods, Second Edition, by Mark H. Holmes.
<br>
<br>
<b>Notes:</b> Lecture notes will be posted after classes. However, they cannot be used as a substitute of your textbook.
<br>
<br>
<b>Aim and Scope:</b> Distinguish between regular and singular perturbation problems. Construct asymptotic expansions and check validity. Apply boundary layer theory, multiple scales, and WKB. Interpret asymptotics in PDEs and applied problems.
<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> This course will require undergraduate background in Mathematical Analysis, Linear Algebra, Ordinary Differential Equations.  However, the more a student brings to the course, the
more the student will get out of it, so graduate courses in these areas can only help. Interested students who are not sure if they have sufficient background are encouraged to email me and discuss their readiness.
<br>
<br>
<b>Grading Policy:</b> homework 60% (six assignments 10% each); Final 40%.
<br>
<br>
<b>Homework:</b>   Mathematics (and problem solving in general) is a collaborative
discipline. You are strongly encouraged to work in groups and to discuss homework problems with your classmates. However, you
<span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> write-up the solution on
your own and it <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> be
in your own words. Anything else is plagiarism and will be treated as
such. <br>
<span></span>Your solution needs to be complete and correct (of
course!), but to recieve full credit your write-up should also meet the
following criteria.
<ul>
<li><span>
All of the important logical steps in the proof should be present and fully explained. <br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span>All assumptions should be clearly identified. <br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span>Your write-up should be clear and concise. (I.e., if a sentence or
paragraph does not advance the reader's understanding of the solution,
it does not belong in the write-up.)</span></li>
  <li><span>Use full and complete English sentences. Symbols should be used
only as a tool to distill a complex mathematical relationship into
a readable format.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>
I <span style="font-weight:bold;">highly</span> suggest that you write up your solution sets using the typsetting program LaTeX which is designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. <a href="https://www.overleaf.com"><b>Overleaf</b></a> is an online LaTeX editor that allows real-time collaboration and online compiling of projects to PDF format. This online editor also provides a number of beautiful templates for completing math homework assignments.
