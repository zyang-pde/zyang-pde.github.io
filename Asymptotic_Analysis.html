<b>Time and Place:</b> MWF 12:00-12:50 at 341 Altgeld Hall.

<br>
<b>Textbook:</b> Linear Algebra, Fourth Edition, by Steven Friedberg, Arnold Insel, and Lawrence Spence.
<br>
<br>
<b>Notes:</b> A course <a href="./M416notes/M416_notes.pdf" target="_blank">notes</a> will collect key ingredients taught in class. However, it cannot be used as a substitute of your textbook.
<br>
<br>
<b>Aim:</b> Math 416 is a rigorous, abstract treatment of linear algebra. Topics to be covered include vector spaces, linear transformations, linear system, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalizability, and inner product spaces. The course concludes with a brief introduction to the theory of canonical forms for matrices and linear transformations. 
Credit is not given for both MATH 416 and either MATH 410 or MATH 415. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> MATH 241; MATH 347 is recommended.
<br>
<br>
<b>Grading Policy:</b> Weekly homework 20%; Midterms 45% (15% each); Final 35%.
<br>
<br>
<b>Inclusive statement:</b>  This classroom is a place where you will be treated with respect. I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, abilities - and other visible or non-visible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class. The effectiveness of this course is dependent upon the creation of an Sexual Misconduct Reporting Obligation encouraging and safe classroom environment. Exclusionary, offensive or harmful speech (such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.) will not be tolerated and in some cases subject to University harassment procedures. We are all responsible for creating a positive and safe environment that allows all students equal respect and comfort. I expect each of you to help establish and maintain and environment where you and your peers can contribute without fear of ridicule or intolerant or offensive language.

There will be three midterms and a final exam on the material covered
in the lectures. Our midterm exams will be held in class.
Our final exam will be scheduled by the registrar's office and I will
let you know once it is scheduled. If you make travel arrangements
before the final exam is scheduled, you should assume that the final
will be held
on the last day of the final exam period.
<b><br>
</b><p></p>
<p><b>Exam 1:</b> Exam is on Sept. 27th and is based on materials taught before Sept. 21st. <!--Solutions can be found <a href="./M416exams/Exam1_solutions.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br> -->
<br>
<b>Exam 2:</b> Exam is on Oct. 25th and is based on materials taught before Oct. 19th. <!--Solutions can be found <a href="./M416exams/Exam2_solutions.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br> -->

Mathematics (and problem solving in general) is a collaborative
discipline. You are strongly encouraged to work in groups and to discuss homework problems with your classmates. However, you
<span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> write-up the solution on
your own and it <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> be
in your own words. Anything else is plagiarism and will be treated as
such. <br>
<span></span>Your solution needs to be complete and correct (of
course!), but to recieve full credit your write-up should also meet the
following criteria.<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><span>
All of the important logical steps in the proof should be present and fully explained. <br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span>All assumptions should be clearly identified. <br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span>Your write-up should be clear and concise. (I.e., if a sentence or
paragraph does not advance the reader's understanding of the solution,
it does not belong in the write-up.)</span></li>
  <li><span>Use full and complete English sentences. Symbols should be used
only as a tool to distill a complex mathematical relationship into
a readable format.</span></li>
<br>
</ul>
<p>

I <span style="font-weight:bold;">highly</span> suggest that you write up your solution sets using the typsetting program LaTeX which is designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. <a href="https://www.overleaf.com"><b>Overleaf</b></a> is an online LaTeX editor that allows real-time collaboration and online compiling of projects to PDF format. This online editor also provides a number of beautiful templates for completing math homework assignments. 
<br>
<br>

I will upload homework here as the course progresses. Homework is due at the beginning of class on every <b>Wednesday</b>. Late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances, however your lowest homework scores will be dropped.
